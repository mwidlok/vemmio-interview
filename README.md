# Vemmio tunnel pool

This is piece of code which should be responsible for managing tunnels.<br>
Tunnel is a connection between device and server, each tunnel has unique id.<br>
TunnelPool is responsible for caching, opening and closing tunnels.

TunnelPool requirements:
<ul>
<li> It should be only one opened Tunnel with specific TunnelId inside the pool.
<li> Tunnel should be reused when is already opened
<li> There could be error when trying open the Tunnel
<li> Pool should be thread safe
<li> Getting Tunnel from the pool should be non blocking
<li> All opened tunnels should be closed when pool is closed (shutdown)
</ul>

## Components
<ul>
<li>App - main program
<li>Tunnel - tunnel betwen device and server
<li>TunnelId - id of the tunnel
<li>TunnelFactory - creates tunnel with specific id
<li>TunnelPool - thread safe, non blocking pool of tunnels
</ul>

## Building and running

mvn clean install

## Prerequisites

<ul>
<li>Java 8
<li>Maven 3
</ul>

# Rules of solution

1. Make fork of this repo
2. All tests should pass - you can write your own tests if needed
3. No changes are allowed to the main program and existing tests code
4. Technology used should remain the same.
5. Everything else can be modified to fulfill tests
